AIM:
 To draw the diagrams [ Usecase, Class, Activity, Sequence, Collaboration, State chart,
Deployment, Component, package] for software personnel management system.
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION:
SL.NO SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION
1.0 Hardware Requirements
1.1 Software Requirements
1.2 Project description
1.3 Reference
1.0 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
 Intel Pentium Processor I3/I5
1.1 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
 Rational Rose/Argo UML
1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
 This software is designed for the process of knowing the details of a person works in a
software company. The details are being stored in the Central Management System for the cross
checking the personâ€™s details.

USECASE DIAGRAM:
 This diagram will contain the actors, usecases which are:
ACTORS: Employee, HR, Central System
USECASE: Name and address, qualification, experience, internet, loan,
verification
ASS DIAGRAM:
 This diagram consists of the following classes, attributes and their operations.
CLASSES ATTRIBUTES OPERATIONS
Central Management System Employee name
Employee number
Tax()
Loan()
Employee1 Employee details Leave taken()
HR Check details Loss of pay()ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:
 This diagram will have the activities as start point, end point, decision boxes as:
ACTIVITIES: Enter the option to check, enter the salary, enter the working days, leave
taken, loss of pay
DECISION BOX: Option QUENCE DIAGRAM:
 This diagram consists of the objects, messages and return messages
OBJECT: Employee, HR, Central System
COLLABORATION DIAGRAM:
 This diagram contains the objects and actors. This will be obtained by the completing of the
sequence diagram and pressing the F5 key
STATECHART DIAGRAM:
It is a technique to describe the behavior of the system. It describes all the possible states
that a particular object gets into the object oriented technique. State diagram are drawn for a
single class to show to the lifetime behaviour of a single objects
COMPONENT DIAGRAM:
The component diagram is represented by figure dependency and it is a graph of design
of figure dependency. The component diagram's main purpose is to show the structural
relationships between the components of a systems. It is represented by boxed figure.
Dependencies are represented by communication association
DEPLOYMENT DIAGRAM:
A deployment diagram in the unified modeling language serves to model the
physical deployment of artifacts on deployment targets. Deployment diagrams show "the
allocation of artifacts to nodes according to the Deployments defined between them. It is
represented by 3- dimentional box. Dependencies are represented by communication association

RESULT:
 Thus the diagram [ usecase, class, activity, sequence, collaboration, state chart, component,
